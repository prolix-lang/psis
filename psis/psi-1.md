## What is a PSI?
PSI stands for Prolix Suggested Improvement. It serve as the primary
mechanisms for proposing major new features, collecting community input
on issues, and documenting design decisions within the Prolix environment.
These PSIs are meticulouslymaintained as text files within a versioned
repository, ensuring a structured approach to managing proposed changes.

The author of a PSI plays a crucial role in fostering consensus within
the community regarding the proposed feature or change. This involves
engaging with community members, soliciting feedback, and addressing
concerns to build agreement. Additionally, the PSI author is responsible
for documenting any dissenting opinions that arise during the discussion
process, ensuring transparency and accountability in decision-making.

One of the key advantages of maintaining PSIs in a versioned repository
is that their revision history serves as a comprehensive historical record
of feature proposals within Prolix. Through standard Git commands, community
members can easily access and retrieve older revisions of PSIs. This
accessibility facilitates transparency and accountability by allowing
stakeholders to review the evolution of feature proposals and design
decisions over time within the Prolix project.

## PSI Audience
The primary audience for PSI (Prolix Suggested Improvement) mainly comprises
core developers responsible for the Prolix reference interpreter. They play
a crucial role in shaping the language's specifications and implementations,
possessing deep insights into Prolix's intricacies.

Additionally, developers working on alternative implementations of the
Prolix language specification benefit from PSI. By adhering to PSI guidelines,
they ensure compatibility and interoperability across different Prolix
implementations, contributing to a cohesive development landscape.

## PSI Categories
- **Informational**: Non-normative PSI within the Prolix ecosystem offers
essential information and guidance to users. It includes instructional
materials and explanations, serving as a comprehensive knowledge base for
understanding and utilizing Prolix resources effectively. This repository
fosters transparency and collaboration, empowering users to make informed
decisions and engage more effectively with the platform.
- **Process**: Normative PSIs in the Prolix community outline proposed
changes to processes, workflows, or governance. They serve to standardize
and improve operational procedures, fostering consistency and efficiency
within the community. These documents provide a framework for
decision-making and collaboration, guiding members in implementing
effective changes to enhance the Prolix ecosystem.
- **Declined**: When a PSI is declined, it signifies that the proposed
document or changehas been officially rejected and will not be accepted
within the Prolix community. This decision may result from various
factors such as incompatibility with existing protocols, insufficient
consensus, or potential negative impacts on the ecosystem. Declined
PSIs serve as a clear indication that the proposed idea or modification
does not align with the community's objectives or standards, and thus
will not be implemented.
- **Tentative**: A tentative PSI indicates that the proposed document
or change has been conditionally accepted within the Prolix ecosystem,
but additional feedback is required before final approval. This status
suggests that while the idea shows promise, further evaluation and
input from stakeholders are necessary to ensure its alignment with
community objectives and standards. Tentative PSIs serve as a signal
of ongoing deliberation and collaboration, allowing for refinement
and enhancement based on constructive feedback. This iterative process
aims to foster consensus and optimize the proposed PSI before it
transitions to a fully accepted status within the Prolix ecosystem.
- **Final**: When a PSI reaches the final stage, it signifies that
the proposed document or change has been fully accepted within the
Prolix ecosystem, and its deployment is either completed or is no
longer active. This status indicates that the PSI has undergone thorough
review, garnered consensus among stakeholders, and has been successfully
integrated into the community's framework. Final PSIs represent a milestone
in the evolution of the Prolix ecosystem, reflecting the culmination of
efforts to improve processes, workflows, or governance. Once a PSI reaches
this stage, it serves as a definitive reference point for operational
procedures or guidelines within the community.
- **Superseded**: When a PSI is marked as "Superseded," it indicates that
the document or change it represents has been replaced by a newer
version or an alternative succeeding PSI within the Prolix ecosystem.
This status signifies that the original PSI is no longer considered
current or active due to the introduction of updated information, revised
processes, or improved guidelines. Users should refer to the succeeding
PSI for the most recent and relevant instructions, as it supersedes the
outdated version and reflects the latest developments within the Prolix
community.

## Start with an idea for Prolix
The PSI (Prolix Specification Improvement) process is a crucial aspect
of refining and evolving Prolix, ensuring that new ideas and proposals
are thoroughly vetted and presented in a structured manner. This process
begins with the inception of a new idea, which is typically recommended
to focus on a single key proposal or concept. The emphasis on singularity
ensures clarity and enhances the likelihood of success for the PSI.

Enhancements and bug fixes that do not necessitate a PSI can be directly
submitted to the Prolix issue tracker. This streamlines the process and
reserves the PSI mechanism for more significant changes or additions to
the language. The PSI editors play a pivotal role in this process, as they
have the authority to reject proposals that appear too broad or unfocused.
This ensures that only well-defined and relevant ideas are considered for
further deliberation.

Central to each PSI is a champion, tasked with shepherding the proposal
through the process. The champion is responsible for drafting the PSI
using the prescribed style and format, facilitating discussions in
relevant forums, and endeavoring to build consensus within the community.
Before embarking on drafting the PSI, the champion must ascertain the
viability of the idea for the PSI process. This typically involves
soliciting feedback from the Prolix community through appropriate
channels, such as the Ideas category on the Prolix Discourse.

The public vetting of ideas serves multiple purposes. It helps prevent
potential authors from investing significant time and effort into proposals
that are likely to be rejected based on prior discussions or community
sentiment. Additionally, it ensures that proposed ideas are relevant and
beneficial to the broader Prolix community, rather than being driven solely
by the author's preferences. The process of vetting also enables authors to
refine their ideas based on initial feedback, increasing the likelihood of
acceptance.

Once the champion has gauged community interest and viability, a draft PSI
is presented to the appropriate venue for further review and refinement.
This stage allows the author to flesh out the proposal, ensuring proper
formatting, high quality, and addressing initial concerns raised by the
community. By iteratively refining the proposal based on feedback, the PSI
process facilitates the development of well-considered and community-driven
enhancements to Prolix.

In conclusion, the PSI process serves as a structured framework for evaluating
and implementing new ideas within the Prolix ecosystem. Through collaboration,
feedback, and consensus-building, the process ensures that proposed changes
align with the needs and aspirations of the Prolix community, ultimately
contributing to the continued evolution and improvement of the language.

## Submitting a PSI
To submit or propose your own Prolix Suggested Improvement (PSI), it's important
to familiarize yourself with the guidelines and procedures outlined within the
repository. These guidelines serve as a framework to ensure that all suggestions
are constructive, well-formulated, and contribute positively to the improvement
